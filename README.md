## 🚀 Quick Start

This notebook demonstrates:

- Calculating and visualizing technical indicators (SMA, ATR, RSI variants)
- Systematic evaluation of RSI models
- Interactive Plotly visualizations
- Fetching live OHLCV data from Binance (crypto)

## 📚 Tutorials

Each tutorial focuses on a key aspect of systematic technical analysis and indicator research:

- [**01 - Using PyTechnicalIndicators with pandas**](./01_using_pandas_and_pytechnicalindicators.md)    
  Basic calculations, series management, and DataFrame usage.

- [**02 - Using PyTechnicalIndicators with Plotly**](./02_using_plotly_and_pytechnicalindicators.md)    
  How to visualize price and overlay technical indicators.

- [**03 - Systematically Evaluating RSI Variants**](./03_advanced_pytechnicalindicators.md) 
  Programmatically benchmark different RSI model types and their effectiveness.

- [**04 - Connecting to a Market Data API**](./04_api_connection.md)    
  Fetching OHLCV data from Binance for live, repeatable research.

- [**05 - Using PyTechnicalIndicators with Jupyter Notebooks**](./05_using_jupyter_and_pytechnicalindicators.ipynb) 
  Best practices for interactive research and reproducible workflows.

## 📈 Example Workflow

1. **Fetch Data**  
   Either via API or CSV.

2. **Calculate Indicators**  
   Compute SMA, ATR, and multiple RSI variants using PyTechnicalIndicators.

3. **Evaluate & Visualize**  
   Score RSI strategies, visualize price and indicators together with Plotly.

4. **Automate & Extend**  
   Batch analyze symbols, customize indicator pipelines, and save results for further research.
